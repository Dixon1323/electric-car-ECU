## Features

This project encompasses several features for an electric vehicle's ECU:

- **Sensor Data**: Reading sensors such as AC sensors, touch/pressure sensors, etc.
- **Display Integration**: Interfacing with graphical displays (e.g., **ILI9341**) and keypads.
- **GPS Data Processing**: Handling GPS module data for location tracking.
- **Time Server Communication**: Synchronizing time with remote servers.
- **Serial Communication**: Managing serial data for diagnostics and control.
- **IoT Integration**: Communicating with IoT platforms like **Blynk**.
- **Multiple Platform Support**: Supports microcontrollers like **ESP8266** and **Arduino Nano**.
- **Test Code**: Includes test code for testing individual components.

> **Note**: The exact features depend on the implementation within each module and hardware configuration.

## Technologies Used

- **C++** for embedded software development
- **ESP8266** and **Arduino Nano** as target microcontroller platforms
- Libraries for display drivers (e.g., **ILI9341**), keypads, GPS, sensors, serial communication, and IoT platforms like **Blynk**.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and flash the firmware to your target microcontroller.

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/electric-car-ecu.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd electric-car-ecu
    ```

3. **Set up your microcontroller development environment:**
    - Install **Arduino IDE** or **PlatformIO**.
    - Ensure your development environment supports **ESP8266** and **Arduino Nano**.

4. **Install necessary libraries:**
    - Libraries required might include **ILI9341** (for displays), **Keypad**, **GPS modules**, **Blynk**, **time servers**, and **serial communication** libraries. Check the individual module directories for specific dependencies.

5. **Open the project code:**
    - Open the relevant code file (e.g., `main_code_esp8266` or `main_code_nano`) in your IDE.

6. **Configure your board settings:**
    - Select the appropriate board (**ESP8266** or **Arduino Nano**) and configure the port settings.

7. **Compile and upload:**
    - Compile the code using your IDE and upload it to the target microcontroller.

> **Note**: The specific library names and setup steps may vary depending on the chosen IDE and board configuration.

## Usage

To use this project with your electric car's ECU, follow these steps:

1. **Upload the correct code:**
    - Upload the code from the appropriate folder (e.g., `main_code_esp8266` or `main_code_nano`) to the respective microcontroller.

2. **Connect hardware components:**
    - Ensure all necessary hardware (e.g., sensors, display, keypad, GPS module) is connected to the microcontroller according to the pinout specifications.
    - Example pinout for **ILI9341** display:
    ```text
    -----------
    ILI9341
    -----------
    vcc----5v
    gnd----gnd
    CS-----D2
    reset--rst
    DC-----D4
    MOSI---D7
    SCK----D5
    LED----3.3v
    MISO---D6
    T_CLK--D5
    T_CS---D1
    T_DW---D7
    T_DO---D6
    T_IRQ--NC
    ```

3. **Power the system:**
    - Once powered on, the system should start operating and processing the input data from the sensors.

4. **Monitor output:**
    - Observe the **serial output** or any connected display to check the system's operation.
    - The **Blynk** integration may also show remote data on your mobile device.

> **Note**: The usage can vary depending on the specific hardware and code configuration being used.
